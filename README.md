# Facial-Detection-Project

The system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify facial expressions into different emotion categories and then maps each category to an appropriate avatar or emoji.

Trained and evaluated the system on the FER2013 dataset, which contains facial expressions collected from real-world videos.

The results show that the system achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing emotions from facial expressions and generating corresponding avatars.

Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms to develop a Python script to detect and recognize Human Facial Expressions with the help of a Webcam.


* Used Keras, which supports TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano as backend engines.
* Used the FER2013 Database to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize Human Facial Expressions 
* Deployed the model using the Flask framework to recognize emotions from a real-time video stream
* Performed rigorous testing to ensure the system works accurately under various conditions and scenarios.
* Implemented quality checks and validation processes to maintain system reliability and accuracy, which resulted in a 96% accuracy for Facial Expression Detection
